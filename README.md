# Interescity Platform API Examples


## Hi, developers!

This repository contains some easy examples for using code in some different
languages to consume the rest API via HTTP requests. We want you to understand
easier the abstractions that we created in the platform, so you can develop
your applications faster.

We provide examples in:

- Ruby
- Python
- [Javascript](javascript/javascript_docs.md)

We also have a wiki page that has a better explanation about the response json
and the kind of objects returned by the services. The more important servers and
a quick resume about them are:

- **DataCollector**: Keeps track of each measurement made by a resource (usually a sensor) in time.
- **ResourceCatalog**: Persist information about of each resource in the city (sensors, buses, hospitals).
- **ResourceDiscovery**: If you want to ``discover`` what are the resources in the city, here is where
you'll take a first look.

## You can reffer to the official documentation for more details.

# HAPPY HACKING!

# Interescity Platform API Examples


## Hi, developers!

This repository contains some easy examples of code in some different
languages to consume the rest API via HTTP requests. We want to make it easier to
understand the abstractions that we've created in the platform, so people can develop
applications faster.

We provide examples in:

- [Ruby](ruby/README.md)
- [Python](python/README.md)
- [Javascript](javascript/README.md)

The more important services and a quick resume about them are:

- **DataCollector**: Keeps track of each measurement made by a resource (usually a sensor) in time.
- **ResourceCatalog**: Persist information about of each resource in the city (sensors, buses, hospitals).
- **ResourceDiscovery**: If you want to ``discover`` what are the resources in the city, here is where
you'll take a first look.

## You can reffer to the [official documentation](http://143.107.45.126:40003/#/) for more details.

# HAPPY HACKING!
